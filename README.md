### API
```ts
import Uploader from 's3-batch-upload';

await new Uploader({
  config: './config/configS3.json', // can also use environment variables
  bucket: 'bucket-name',
  localPath: './files',
  remotePath: 'remote/path/in/bucket',
  glob: '*.jpg', // default is '*.*'
  concurrency: '200', // default is 100
  dryRun: true, // default is false
}).upload();
```

### S3 Authentication

As seem above, you can either use environment variables, or a config file.

When using a config file, add it to the `.gitignore`, because you don't want your credentials
in your repo. Use the following template for the config file as stated in the [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-json-file.html):

```json
{
  "accessKeyId": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>", 
  "secretAccessKey": "<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>", 
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

When using environment variables, check the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-environment.html).
